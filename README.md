# Brain Tumor Detection using Federated Learning

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a brain tumor detection project using Federated Learning (FL). The project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting brain tumors from medical imaging data while preserving patient privacy through the use of FL.

## Key Features

- Developed a machine learning model for brain tumor detection using FL.
- Utilized FL to train the model collaboratively across multiple decentralized devices while keeping patient data on-device.
- Ensured privacy and data security by employing techniques such as differential privacy and encryption.
- Achieved high accuracy in brain tumor detection while maintaining patient confidentiality.
- Implemented visualization tools for interpreting model predictions and monitoring FL training progress.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure that the medical imaging data is properly formatted and accessible.
2. **Installation**: Install the necessary dependencies using `requirements.txt`.
3. **Model Training**: Run the provided scripts for training the brain tumor detection model using FL.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on test data and visualize the results.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model in a secure environment for real-world usage.
